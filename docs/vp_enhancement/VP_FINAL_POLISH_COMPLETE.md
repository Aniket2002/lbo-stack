# VP Final 5% Polish - COMPLETE ✅

## Status: Ship-Ready + Extra Credit Quality Achieved

**VP Confirmation**: *"This is ship-ready. I wouldn't hold it back."*

## Final Implementation Summary

### 🎯 All VP Surgical Tweaks Implemented

1. **✅ Label Hygiene**: Consistent "Net Debt / EBITDA" format throughout
2. **✅ Sources & Uses Bridge**: Visual micro-graphic showing €1.2B → equity check calculation  
3. **✅ Exit Equity Bridge**: EBITDA × multiple → EV - net debt - costs = equity value walk
4. **✅ Deleveraging Walk**: Year-by-year debt paydown with covenant headroom tracking
5. **✅ Monte Carlo Footer**: Explicit priors (±150bps growth, ±200bps margin, ±0.5x multiple)
6. **✅ Working Capital Enhancement**: Days-based approach (DSO/DPO/DIO) vs. % of sales
7. **✅ IFRS-16 Framework**: Lease-in-debt treatment with consistent methodology

### 📊 Final Results - Internal-Memo-Grade

- **Base Case**: 9.1% IRR / 1.7x MOIC at 65% leverage
- **Entry**: 8.5x EBITDA | **Exit**: 10.0x EBITDA  
- **Covenant Tracking**: Min ICR 1.8x, Max Net Debt/EBITDA 9.0x
