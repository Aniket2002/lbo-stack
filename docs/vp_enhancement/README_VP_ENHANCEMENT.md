## 🏗️ VP Surgical Tweaks (Internal-Memo-Grade)

✅ **Label Hygiene**: "Net Debt / EBITDA" everywhere + "LTV % = Net Debt / EV" footnote  
✅ **Sources & Uses Bridge**: Entry micro-graphic with fees/OID → equity cheque  
✅ **Exit Equity Bridge**: EBITDA × multiple → EV − net debt (incl. leases) = equity  
✅ **Deleveraging Walk**: Net Debt/EBITDA by year (explains 1.7× → 9% IRR)  
✅ **Monte Carlo Footer**: σ priors + success definition explicitly listed

## 🏢 IFRS-16 Method Consistency

**Framework**: Lease-in-debt approach throughout analysis
- **Entry**: Operating leases capitalized at 8× rent (€1.25bn for Accor)
- **Ongoing**: Lease liability included in Net Debt for covenant calculations  
- **Exit**: Consistent lease treatment in enterprise value calculation
- **Rationale**: Conservative hospitality sector standard, rating agency aligned

## 📊 Core Results (VP Framework)

- **Base Case**: 9.1% IRR / 1.7× MOIC at 65% leverage (8.5× in / 9.0× out)
- **Covenants**: Min ICR 2.5× vs 2.2×, Max Net Debt/EBITDA 8.4× vs 9.0× (no breaches)
- **Sensitivity**: 3×3 IRR grid (margin ±400bps, exit ±1×) 
- **Monte Carlo**: 400 paths, median ~10%, P10-P90 ~2%-15%, 100% success rate
- **Exit Equity**: €4,886m with consistent lease treatment

## 💼 VP Recruiter-Ready Narrative

*"Using a lease-in-debt framework for Accor, base returns are ~9% IRR / 1.7× MOIC at 65% leverage with 8.5× in / 9.0× out. We track covenants explicitly—min ICR 2.5×, max Net Debt/EBITDA 8.4×, no breaches—and run both grid and Monte Carlo risk views; MC (400 paths) gives a ~10% median IRR with ~2–15% P10–P90 and 100% success under calibrated priors. The appendix explains the IFRS-16 choice and keeps lease treatment consistent at entry and exit."*
